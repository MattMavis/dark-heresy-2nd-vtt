        (5) Trait in addition to enhancing one sense beyond its normal ability. The psyker

        Sharpening the sense of smell grants the psyker an additional +20 bonus on a Survival

        tracked (a piece of clothing, a freshly severed appendage, etc.). This bonus stacks
        with the +30 granted normally by this power.        Touch: A psyker with a heightened
        sense of touch may see objects as he touches them, regardless of available light.
        For example, he may run his fingers across embossed script to read it in a pitch-black
        room.        Taste: Those trained in this power have had to test their senses
        as part of the process of learning its use. So honed is the psykers sense of taste
        while enhanced by this power that he can recognise the presence of poison in foods
        he samples by making a successful Challenging (+0) Awareness Test. This test is
        made prior to swallowing any food and thus, assuming the food is not laden with
        a massive dose of poison, he may spit it out before it takes effect.      Sharpened
        Senses lasts for a number of rounds equal to the psykers Psy Rating. This power
        may be activated multiple times, each time with a new sense enhanced (although

    description: If his target is a willing ally, the targets core body temperature drops
        and all of his metabolic processes virtually cease. The character immediately
        enters a trance, which lasts for a number of days up to the Psy Rating at which
        the power was activated (the psyker chooses the number of days at the time of
        activation). For this time, the target does not need to breath or eat, ignores
        environment effects including that of the vacuum, and he does not need to roll
        to survive ongoing negative effects such as Blood Loss. Each Degree of Success
        on the Focus Power Test doubles the maximum potential duration. Characters under
        the effects of Embrace of Emptiness appear dead to all mundane senses. Further,
        they may not take any Actions, nor may they exit this state until its duration
        expires or they have the assistance of a psyker trained in this Technique. If
        he succeeds but the target chooses to resist the Technique, the target must make
        a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test. If it fails, it gains 1 level of Fatigue and
        its movement speed is halved until the end of its next Turn.

    description: All living creatures (but not Daemons, machines, or other non-living entities)
        except the psyker within a number of metres equal to his Psy Rating around the
        chosen point resist the Technique with an Opposed Willpower Test. Targets that
        fail this Opposed Test suffer one level of Fatigue, plus one level of Fatigue
        per three Degrees by which they failed the Test. The psyker gains one level of
        Fatigue for each target in the radius that resists the Technique. The Astropath
        may choose to have any target that passes into unconsciousness because of levels
        of Fatigue gained from this Technique freeze solid. Until it regains consciousness,
        a creature frozen this way does not need to breath and suffers no ill effects
        from the vacuum. However, also shatters if struck with sufcient force, and therefore
        counts its Toughness as 0 against any Impact Damage that it suffers.

    description: For as long as he sustains the Technique, the psyker has no need for air
        or warmth. For this time, he is also immune to all effects of suffocation and
        vacuum (see ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook page 261) and gains the benets of the Resistance
        (Cold) and Resistance (Poison) Talents for the duration of the ability. Further,
        he expresses a chilling aura that pervades his very being and rips the breath
        from those who strike at him. Whenever any creature would make a Melee Attack
        against him, that creature must rst make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test with
        a 5 Penalty for each Psy Rating. If the creature fails, it suffers a 20 Penalty
        on the attack and gains one level of Fatigue as the cold radiating from the psyker
        saps its strength.
